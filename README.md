# SMPS-circuit
SMPS (Switched-Mode Power Supply) is a circuit that utilizes high-frequency switching to efficiently convert electrical power.. 
This Repository comprises the PCB design of the SMPS circuit(Switched Mode Power Supply).
What is SMPS ?
         A switched-mode  power supply or in short SMPS is a power supply circuit that converts mains power using switching devices that are turned on and off at high frequencies, and storage components such as inductors or capacitors to  supply power efficiently for the load.
