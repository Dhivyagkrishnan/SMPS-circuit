This repository displays the PCB design of the SMPS circuit built in Easyeda tool !
## What is SMPS ??
 An SMPS (Switched Mode Power Supply) is an electronic circuit that converts input power from the main source into a regulated output voltage or current for electronic devices. Unlike linear power supplies, which use a transformer and linear regulator, SMPS uses high-frequency switching techniques to achieve higher efficiency.

## 1. Input Stage:

 **Component** | **Description**
---------|----------
P1         | This represents the AC power input to the circuit.
D3         | This is a bridge rectifier, which converts the AC input into a pulsating DC voltage.
C18 & C19  | These capacitors smooth out the pulsating DC voltage from the rectifier, producing a relatively stable DC voltage.

## 2. Control Stage:

**Component** | **Description**
---------|----------
U5 | This is  a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) controller IC. The PWM controller is responsible for generating a switching signal that controls the primary MOSFET.
D5 | This is a flyback diode, which is part of the feedback loop mechanism in the PWM controller. The flyback diode's voltage is fed back to the PWM controller to adjust the switching frequency and duty cycle for regulating the output voltage.
R8 & R14 | These resistors are the part of the voltage divider network used to provide feedback to the PWM controller.
C16 | This capacitor is used to filter the feedback signal.

## 3. Primary Side:

**Component** | **Description**
---------|----------
L2 | This is the primary inductor of the transformer.
U1 | The transformer is the core of the SMPS. It steps up the input voltage and transfers energy to the secondary side.
D7 | This is a primary-side switch ( MOSFET) controlled by the PWM signal generated by U5. The MOSFET turns on and off rapidly, creating a pulsed current in the primary inductor.
L4 | This is a primary-side choke, which helps to smooth the current flowing through the MOSFET.

## 4. Secondary Side:

 **Component** | **Description**
---------|----------
D6 | This diode rectifies the secondary voltage, converting it from AC to DC.
C20 | This capacitor filters the rectified DC voltage, providing a relatively stable output voltage.
C17 | This capacitor further smoothes the output voltage and acts as a reservoir to provide current during load changes.

## 5. Output Regulation:
 **Component** | **Description**
---------|----------
U8 | This is a precision shunt regulator IC. It monitors the output voltage and adjusts the feedback signal to the PWM controller, maintaining the desired output voltage.
R21 & R16 | These resistors are part of the voltage divider network for the shunt regulator.
Q1 | This transistor is used to provide additional current limiting or protection for the output

## Overall function :

This SMPS circuit takes a DC input from the rectifier, and using PWM control of a switching MOSFET, modulates the current in the primary winding of the transformer. This induces a higher voltage in the secondary winding, which is rectified and filtered to produce a DC output. The output voltage is regulated by the shunt regulator (U8) and the feedback loop, maintaining a stable output voltage even under varying load conditions.
